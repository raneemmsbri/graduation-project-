ZeroEyes: AI-Powered Real-Time Threat Detection SystemZeroEyes is an advanced surveillance solution designed to enhance public safety through proactive threat identification. By integrating state-of-the-art Deep Learning models, the system detects firearms, fire outbreaks, and violent activities in real-time, providing security personnel with the intelligence needed to intervene before incidents escalate.


Core TechnologiesThe system utilizes a multi-layered AI architecture to ensure high-speed processing and reliability:Object Detection (YOLOv8): Optimized for high-speed detection of Firearms and Fire/Smoke in live video streams.Action Recognition (MobileNet + Bi-LSTM): A hybrid approach where MobileNet extracts spatial features and Bi-directional LSTM analyzes temporal sequences to identify Violent Actions.Facial Recognition: Integrated to identify and track Suspicious Individuals against known databases.Web-Based Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring, video analysis, and automated reporting.
