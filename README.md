ZeroEyes: AI-Powered Real-Time Threat Detection System
ZeroEyes is an advanced surveillance solution designed to enhance public safety through proactive threat identification. By integrating state-of-the-art Deep Learning models, the system detects firearms, fire outbreaks, and violent activities in real-time, providing security personnel with the intelligence needed to intervene before incidents escalate.

Core Technologies
The system utilizes a multi-layered AI architecture to ensure high-speed processing and reliability:

Object Detection (YOLOv8): Optimized for high-speed detection of Firearms and Fire/Smoke in live video streams.

Action Recognition (MobileNet + Bi-LSTM): A hybrid approach where MobileNet extracts spatial features and Bi-directional LSTM analyzes temporal sequences to identify Violent Actions.

Facial Recognition: Integrated to identify and track Suspicious Individuals against known databases.

Web-Based Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring, video analysis, and automated reporting.

Performance & Results
The effectiveness of the ZeroEyes system is reflected in the high accuracy and precision scores achieved across all three primary detection modules.

1. Fire Detection Performance
The Fire Detection module, powered by YOLOv8, stands as the most accurate component of the system, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 98.3%. It demonstrated flawless reliability with a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 1.00, resulting in a near-perfect F1 score of 0.99. This ensures that fire and smoke are identified immediately without false alarms.

2. Weapon Detection Performance
The Weapon Detection module successfully identified firearms with an accuracy of 90.09%. The model maintains a perfect precision of 1.00, ensuring that every weapon alert is genuine, complemented by a recall of 0.96 and an F1 score of 0.86. This high sensitivity is crucial for preventing potential armed escalations in public spaces.

3. Violence Detection Performance
For the detection of physical altercations, the hybrid MobileNet and Bi-LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 86.0%. It remains highly effective at catching incidents as they happen, boasting a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 0.96, which culminates in a strong F1 score of 0.942.
